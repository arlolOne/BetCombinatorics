## Combinatorial generator

The combinatorial generator is a desktop application (WinForm). This app solves the particular task of a generation of combinatorial fields within the bet domain. The field has a fixed size and its sample is in TestInput.txt. On based an input field, 759.375 fields are generated and analysed. Then we get useful information to predict a next value bet.
